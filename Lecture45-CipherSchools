DATA STRUCTURES

--TREE

A non-linear data structure is a tree.
Every node may link to other nodes and have some data on it.
A Few Terminologies- Parent, Sibling, Root Child, Leaf Ancestor

--SINGLE TREE
a tree where a node can have a maximum of two children.

In a proper binary tree, every node can have two children or none at all.
Whole Binary Tree: Every level, maybe with the exception of the last, is fully filled, and every node is as far to the left as feasible.
A perfect binary tree would have every level full to the brim.
Balanced Binary Tree: Every node's left and right subtree height differences do not exceed k (usually k = 1).
