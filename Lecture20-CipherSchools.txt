Big oh notation (O) 
Asymptotic upper bounds are expressed using big oh notation. 
It is defined as an algorithm's upper bound, which is the maximum time needed (the worst-case performance).
0 <= f(n) <= Cg(n) for all n >= n0


Big Omega notation (Ω) 
Asymptotic lower bound is provided by Big Omega notation. 
It is defined as the lower limit, and the lowest bound on an algorithm is the minimum time needed (the most effective method, or best case scenario).
0 <= Cg(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0


 Big Theta notation (Θ) 
Tightest bound is defined as the best of all possible worst-case times that the algorithm can achieve.
0 <= C2g(n) <= f(n) <= C1g(n) for n >= n0
